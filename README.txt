###### As the sole engineer aboard a starship, you are responsible for ensuring that your ship makes it through the perils of deep space in one piece! ######

At your Captain's orders, you will have to provide power to systems to overcome the obstables on your journey. Systems will start to overheat when you power the up, and it's your job to find time to cool them down.

## Controls ##
